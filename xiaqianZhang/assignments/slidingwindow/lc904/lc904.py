# Problem Statement #

# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, 
# and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

# You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. 
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

Input: array of character
Output: return the maximum of two unique characters in a row

    while loop that len of the dictionary is greater than 2:
      initliaze the index value for the windowStart index
      decrement the count of the windowStart index
      if the count is equal to 0:

    increment the windowStart as it moves to next index 0 -> 1
  update the maxNum
